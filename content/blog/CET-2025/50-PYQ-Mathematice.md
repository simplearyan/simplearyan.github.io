## 50 Previous Year Quantitative Aptitude Questions with Solutions

Presented here are 50 practice-oriented quantitative aptitude questions based on the Haryana CET exam pattern, with fully worked solutions for each. This selection covers core topics: Number System, HCF \& LCM, Ratio-Proportion, Percentages, Averages, Profit \& Loss, SI \& CI, Simplification, Time \& Work, Time-Speed-Distance, Fractions, Decimals, and Data Interpretation.[^1][^2][^3]

## 1. The price of tea increases by 20%. To keep expenses the same, by what percent should a man decrease his consumption?

**Solution:**
Let initial price = ₹100/kg, initial consumption = 1kg.
New price = ₹120/kg. Let new consumption = x kg.

Expense remains: 100×1 = 120×x ⇒ x = 100/120 = 5/6
Required decrease = (1 - 5/6)×100 = 16.67% decrease.

## 2. The sum of five consecutive odd numbers is 125. What is their average?

**Solution:**
Average = 125/5 = 25

## 3. Find the least number which when divided by 6, 9, 15, and 18 leaves a remainder 5 in each case.

**Solution:**
LCM of 6, 9, 15, 18 = 90
Number = 90k + 5, least number is 95.

## 4. What is 35% of 700?

## 10. If a shopkeeper sold an article for ₹300 with 20% profit, find the cost price.

**Solution:**
Let CP = x; SP = x + 20%x = 1.2x = 300 ⇒ x = 250

## 11. Find SI on ₹1200 at 10% per annum for 2 years.

**Solution:**
SI = (1200×10×2)/100 = ₹240

## 12. What is the value of 8 + 4 × 2?

**Solution:**

## 16. Rakesh gets 80% in an exam of 500 marks. Find the marks scored.

**Solution:**
= (80/100)×500 = 400

## 17. If the cost price is ₹6000, marked price ₹7800, and profit after discount is 4%, find the discount percent.

**Solution:**
SP=CP+Profit=6000+4% of 6000=6240
Discount=7800-6240=1560
Discount % = (1560/7800)×100 = 20%

## 18. A sum doubles in 8 years at simple interest. Find the rate.

**Solution:**
