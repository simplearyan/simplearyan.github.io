## give me tricks to solve faster above questions with ease to understand

Here are **easy-to-understand tricks and shortcuts** to solve the previously shared quantitative aptitude questions faster, grouped by topic with simple explanations and examples:

### 1. Number System Tricks

- **Divisibility rules** help quickly find HCF/LCM, e.g.,
*6 divisible by 2 and 3; 15 divisible by 3 and 5*, etc.
- **Shortcut for LCM and HCF:**
Use prime factorization or the relation:
$\text{LCM} \times \text{HCF} = \text{Product of two numbers}$.


### 2. HCF \& LCM Speed Tips

- Factorize numbers into primes quickly (2,3,5,7,11 steps).
- For multiple numbers: Take highest powers of common prime factors for LCM, and lowest powers for HCF.
- When numbers are multiples, LCM is the largest number, HCF is the smaller.


### 3. Ratio \& Proportion Tricks

- Add parts of the ratio for total parts.
- Share quantity proportionally:
For ratio 2:3 and total 1200 â†’ each part = 1200/5 = 240 â†’ Multiply parts accordingly.


### 4. Percentages Tips

- **Express increase/decrease directly:**
Increase by x% â†’ multiply by (100 + x)/100.
Decrease by x% â†’ multiply by (100 - x)/100.
- Use complements like 25% = 1/4, 50% = 1/2 to simplify calculations.


### 5. Average Calculation Shortcuts

- Use total sum = average Ã— number of values directly.
- For changing averages after an addition/removal, multiply new average by new number to find sum and subtract old sum to find value.


### 6. Profit \& Loss Shortcuts

- Profit % formula: $\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \times 100$.
- To find CP when SP and profit % are given:
$CP = \frac{SP \times 100}{100 + \text{Profit \%}}$.
- For discount: SP = Marked Price Ã— (100 - Discount %)/100.


### 7. Simple \& Compound Interest Shortcuts

- **SI:** Multiply principal, rate, time, divide by 100 directly.
- **CI:** Use formula $A = P \times (1 + \frac{R}{100})^T$. For 2 years, square the multiplier to save time.
- Approximate compound interest by finding the difference between CI and SI if needed.


### 8. Simplification Tips (BODMAS)

- Always do multiplication/division before addition/subtraction.
- Handle brackets first.
- For expressions like $6 Ã· 2(1+2)$, solve inside bracket, then do division and multiplication from left to right.


### 9. Time \& Work Tricks

- Work done is inversely proportional to time.
- If A does work in $x$ days, daily work = $\frac{1}{x}$. For combined work, add daily works.
- To find time taken by combined workers: \$ Total work / combined daily work\$.


### 10. Time-Speed-Distance Shortcuts

- Use formula $Speed = \frac{Distance}{Time}$.
- Convert time to hours if given in minutes.
- For relative speed in opposite directions: Add speeds; for same direction: subtract speeds.


### 11. Fractions \& Decimals Tips

- Convert fractions to decimals by dividing numerator by denominator mentally if easy multiples.
- Memorize common fraction-decimal equivalents (e.g., 1/4=0.25, 1/8=0.125).
- For addition/subtraction, convert to common denominator quickly.


### 12. Data Interpretation Tricks

- Sum columns or rows quickly with mental math (round numbers if allowed to estimate).
- Read questions carefully: sometimes percentage or difference questions only need parts of data.
- Practice spotting trends â€” increasing/decreasing â€” to answer quickly.


### General Speed-Up Tips

- **Practice mental calculations** daily for multiplication/division.
- Use **approximation** when exact value is not needed to shortlist answers.
- **Write formulas on top** of your sheet for quick reference.
- Avoid re-reading questions multiple timesâ€”read carefully once.
- Use **elimination technique** when guessing: remove obviously wrong choices.
