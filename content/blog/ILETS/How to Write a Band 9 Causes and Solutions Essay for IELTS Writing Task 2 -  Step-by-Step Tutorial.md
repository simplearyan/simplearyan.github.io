## IELTS Writing Task 2: Step-by-Step Tutorial ‚úçÔ∏èüåç

In IELTS Writing Task 2, **causes and solutions essays** are a very common question type. This tutorial will guide you on how to approach such essays, plan effectively, and write a high-scoring Band 9 answer with clear examples.

***

## Step 1: Understand the Question Carefully üîç

- The question typically presents a problem and asks you:

1. **What are the main causes?**
2. **What are the possible solutions?**

**Example question:**

> *‚ÄúHuman activity is causing the extinction of species and loss of biodiversity worldwide. What are the primary causes and what solutions can be proposed?‚Äù*

Make sure you understand both parts‚Äîcauses and solutions‚Äîbefore you start writing.

***

## Step 2: Plan Your Essay Structure üèóÔ∏è

A Band 9 causes and solutions essay usually has this structure:

1. **Introduction:** Paraphrase the question and state you will discuss causes and solutions.
2. **Body Paragraph 1:** Describe the main causes of the problem.
3. **Body Paragraph 2:** Suggest and explain solutions.
4. **Conclusion:** Summarize the main points briefly.

Spend 2-4 minutes planning your ideas before writing‚Äîit saves time and helps your essay stay focused.

***

## Step 3: Generate Ideas üí°

Think simply and logically about:

- The **problem** (already given in the question).
- **Causes** ‚Äî why has this problem arisen?
- **Solutions** ‚Äî how can it be solved?


### Example Ideas:

**Causes:**

- Human changes to natural habitats (building roads, deforestation).
- Pollution altering ecosystems.
- Overexploitation of natural resources (overfishing).

**Solutions:**

- Protecting natural areas (wildlife reserves, national parks).
- Raising public awareness about environmental issues.

***

## Step 4: Write the Introduction üìù

Paraphrase the question and introduce the two essay parts.

**Example Introduction:**

> Despite widespread awareness of biodiversity‚Äôs importance, human activities continue to cause many species to disappear. This essay will examine the primary causes of biodiversity loss and suggest possible solutions to tackle this issue.

***

## Step 5: Write Body Paragraph 1 ‚Äì Causes üå≥

- Start with a **topic sentence** that outlines the main causes.
- Explain causes clearly with linking phrases.
- Provide **examples** to illustrate points.

**Example:**

> The two main causes of species extinction are habitat destruction and resource exploitation. When humans build roads and cities, they destroy natural environments that many animals depend on. For example, deforestation for housing reduces forest areas where wildlife live. Moreover, activities like overfishing reduce species populations, as fish have less time to reproduce in heavily fished areas.

***

## Step 6: Write Body Paragraph 2 ‚Äì Solutions üõ†Ô∏è

- Start with a sentence introducing solutions.
- Explain each solution clearly with transition words.
- You may or may not include specific examples‚Äîboth are acceptable.

**Example:**

> To address this problem, it is essential to protect natural habitats from further destruction and to raise awareness about biodiversity loss. Establishing wildlife reserves can safeguard animals‚Äô homes and prevent extinction. Additionally, educating the public about environmental conservation encourages responsible behavior and support for protective measures.

***

## Step 7: Write a Clear Conclusion üîö

- Summarize causes and solutions briefly.
- Avoid new ideas or details.

**Example:**

> To conclude, human activities such as habitat destruction and resource exploitation are key causes of biodiversity loss. However, protecting natural areas and promoting environmental awareness can effectively combat this problem.

***

## Additional Tips for Band 9 Success üåü

- Use various linking words: *moreover*, *for example*, *to address this problem*, *in addition*.
- Make sure your essay flows logically from causes to solutions.
- Vary sentence structures and use academic vocabulary.
- Stay focused and avoid writing irrelevant ideas.
- Write about 250-280 words to balance depth and time constraints.
