## Step 1: Understand the Pie Chart 🎯

- Pie charts show proportions of different categories as slices of a circle.
- Examine the **chart title**, **labels**, and **percentages**.
- Identify the **time frame** and the **categories involved**, e.g., economic sectors in 2000 and 2016.

***

## Step 2: Write the Introduction 📝

- Paraphrase the question prompt using synonyms.
- Keep the word **“pie chart”** as it is; don’t replace it with “graph” or “chart.”
- Mention what the chart shows and the period it covers.

**Example:**

> The two pie charts illustrate how various industry sectors contributed to Turkey’s economy in terms of percentage in the years 2000 and 2016.

***

## Step 3: Write the Overview Paragraph 🌟

- Summarize 2-4 major features without using specific data.
- Mention the biggest and smallest sectors in each pie chart.
- Describe general changes and comparisons.

**Example:**

> Overall, construction was the smallest sector in 2000 while agriculture was the largest contributor. By 2016, healthcare and education had become the dominant sector, and finance and business services contributed the least to the economy.

Useful phrases to vary language:

- “Contributed the least to the economy”
- “Made the highest contribution”
- “Was the most significant part”

Start your overview with **“Overall,”** which signals a summary to the examiner.

***

## Step 4: Describe Specific Details with Data 🎯

- Organize details in 2-3 paragraphs: group sectors by increasing versus decreasing trends or any logical grouping.
- Use actual percentages and years.
- Use synonyms to avoid repetition for words like “increased,” “decreased,” “remained stable.”

**Example Paragraph 1 (Increasing Sectors):**

> The construction sector saw a dramatic rise from 3% in 2000 to 10% in 2016. Trade, utilities, and transportation increased modestly from 14% to 16%. Manufacturing and finance sectors also grew from 8% and 5% to 12% and 8% respectively.

**Example Paragraph 2 (Decreasing and Stable Sectors):**

> In contrast, agriculture, which accounted for nearly a quarter of the economy in 2000, fell to 14% by 2016. The government and leisure sectors also declined by around 3%. However, healthcare and education remained stable at 17% throughout the period.

***

## Step 5: Vocabulary and Expression Tips ✨

- Use estimates when data isn’t exact: **about, approximately, nearly, roughly, almost**.
- Use strong verbs and adjectives:
    - *Rose dramatically*
    - *Saw a modest growth*
    - *Fell steadily*
    - *Remained stable*
- Use comparatives and contrasts:
    - *In comparison,*
    - *While X increased, Y decreased.*
    - *Despite the decrease in X, Y remained constant.*

***

## Step 6: Avoid Conclusions or Personal Opinions 🚫

- Task 1 is descriptive only.
- The overview acts as your summary, so no conclusion is needed.
