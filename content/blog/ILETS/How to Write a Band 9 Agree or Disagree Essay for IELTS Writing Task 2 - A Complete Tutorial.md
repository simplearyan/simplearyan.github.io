## Step 1: Understand the Question 📋

Agree or disagree questions ask you to take a clear position—either you **agree** or **disagree** with a statement. Some versions also ask *to what extent* you agree or disagree, but your opinion should always be clear.

**Example question:**

> "A big salary is much more important than job satisfaction. Do you agree or disagree? Provide relevant examples."

***

## Step 2: Choose Your Opinion Clearly ✅❌

- You must choose **either full agreement** or **complete disagreement** with the statement.
- Avoid mixed or neutral opinions; this clarity helps examiners award higher scores.
- If unsure, pick the side you can support with stronger points.

***

## Step 3: Generate Supporting Points 💡

Think of 2-3 reasons supporting your chosen opinion. For the example question:

- **If you agree:**
    - A high salary provides financial security and life satisfaction.
    - Money supports basic needs and lifestyle improvements.
- **If you disagree:**
    - Job satisfaction leads to happiness and motivation.
    - Enjoying work promotes career growth and life fulfillment.

***

## Step 4: Plan Your Essay Structure 🏗️

A Band 9 essay typically includes:

1. **Introduction** — Paraphrase the question and state your opinion clearly.
2. **Body Paragraph 1** — Reason \#1 supporting your opinion.
3. **Body Paragraph 2** — Reason \#2 supporting your opinion.
4. **Conclusion** — Summarize your opinion and key points briefly.

***

## Step 5: Writing the Introduction ✍️

- Paraphrase the question using synonyms and different sentence structures.
- Clearly state your position (agree or disagree) at the end of the introduction.

**Example:**

> It is often argued that choosing a job with a high salary is more advantageous than job satisfaction. However, I completely disagree and believe that job satisfaction is far more important than salary.

***

## Step 6: Writing Body Paragraphs with Examples 📝

Use this 5-sentence template for each body paragraph:

1. **State your main reason.**
*Firstly, I believe job satisfaction provides a sense of fulfillment that money cannot guarantee.*
2. **Explain your reason.**
*Even if someone makes a high salary but feels unhappy, they will not enjoy a good quality of life.*
3. **Elaborate further.**
*On the other hand, pursuing work one enjoys brings pleasure and motivation.*
4. **Give a relevant example.**
*For example, many famous scientists chose their careers out of passion, not for financial gain.*
5. **Summarize.**
*Therefore, fulfillment from work outweighs the importance of a high salary.*

Repeat a similar format for the second reason:

> Secondly, doing what you like keeps individuals motivated, often leading to better career success and productivity. For instance, noted author Henry Miller left a stable job for writing and eventually became very successful. Hence, the benefits of job satisfaction surpass those of salary in the long run.

***

## Step 7: Writing a Strong Conclusion 🔚

- Briefly restate your opinion and summarize your main points.
- Use phrases like:
    - *To conclude,*
    - *In summary,*
    - *Overall,*

**Example:**

> To conclude, I strongly believe job satisfaction is more beneficial than a high salary because it brings happiness and motivation, which ultimately leads to greater success.

***

## Final Tips for Band 9 Success 🌟

- Use varied sentence structures and advanced vocabulary.
- Stay on topic and avoid irrelevant information.
- Write between 260–290 words for balance; don’t go too short or too long.
- Proofread quickly for grammar and spelling if time permits.
