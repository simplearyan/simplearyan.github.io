## Unfiltered Reality: Inside Jobha, a Tribal Village in Chhattisgarh 🙏💧🛣️

Hey everyone, Samdish here! 👋 Welcome back to "Bharat Ek Khoj" where we travel across India to bring you the stories and realities of our fellow citizens. This time, our journey took us deep into Chhattisgarh, specifically to the Bastar district, known for its tribal communities. We set out to visit a village and understand the lives of people there.

We ended up in a village called Jobha, located in the Kondagaon district. It's part of a larger area with 8 settlements under one panchayat.

### The Road Less Travelled (Literally!) 🚧

Getting to Jobha was an adventure in itself! As soon as we entered the Kondagaon district, the road seemed to... well, it ended. Shyam Sundar Netam, one of the villagers we met, described it simply: "No sir, this is the only way. This is the only way". The **road condition is "very bad"**, and villagers feel it "should be built properly". This seems to be a major concern for them.

### Life in Jobha: Daily Struggles 😥

Jobha is home to around 1900 voters. Most residents are farmers, primarily involved in **Kharif cultivation**, growing crops like maize. But farming alone isn't enough. When the Kharif season is over, villagers often work as **labourers**. Shyam Sundar Netam shared that he travels as far as Tamil Nadu for field work and digging borewells, staying for **4 to 6 months every year**. This migration for work is common for many labourers from Chhattisgarh.

One of the most critical issues highlighted was the **water problem**. Villagers face "a lot of water scarcity," especially in summer. They have **no pipeline supply at home**. The entire village, or at least certain settlements within it, relies on a **single source of water, a hand pump**. Fetching water isn't easy; girls and women have to do it **every single day**, sometimes multiple times a day. An older gentleman, born in 1967, mentioned that primarily women go to fetch water, although he sometimes helps.

Another significant challenge is **unemployment**, particularly among the **educated youth**. One person Samdish spoke to mentioned that educated young people in Kondagaon are "Sitting here, holding hands" as there are no jobs. The lack of government jobs is a perceived problem.

Heartbreakingly, the sources describe a situation where **children are also working**. One woman shared that she cooks food daily for 150 kids but only gets **1500 rupees per month** (with a promised 500 rupee increase not yet deposited). This highlights the tough economic reality where even basic needs are a struggle.

Basic amenities seem lacking. One villager noted he doesn't wear slippers, though others in his family might.

### Politics and Promises vs. Reality 🤔🗳️

Villagers stated that politicians come, ask for votes, and win, but they **don't do any work** once elected. They feel they have not received benefits no matter who is in power [15, 18 - *using broader sources for context here*]. Promises are made, but not kept [3, 4, 92, 141 - *using broader sources for context here*].

The village does have a school, but it only goes up to the 7th standard. For higher education, students must travel 8 km to Talala. This likely makes continuing education difficult for many.

### Samdish's Reflections 🙏🇮🇳

Visiting Jobha left a strong impression on Samdish and the crew. He reflected that while the government is sometimes portrayed as having solved all problems, places like Jobha show that **"real problems still exist"**. He noted that the problems of his co-citizens revealed how **"the margin for governance in their lives is so f**king big"**.

The experience reinforced the purpose of the "Bharat Ek Khoj" series – to show the truth, understand the lives of fellow citizens, and hopefully reach the authorities who can make a change. Samdish urged viewers to share the video so that the problems of Jobha village can reach those in power.

It's a powerful reminder that even in the 21st century, many communities in India face significant challenges related to infrastructure, employment, and basic needs.
