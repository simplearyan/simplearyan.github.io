## Sample Answers and Examples

### IELTS Writing Task 1 Sample Answer (Academic - Bar Chart)

> The bar chart illustrates the number of visitors to three London museums over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020. Overall, the British Museum attracted the highest number of visitors throughout the years. Visitor numbers for all museums increased steadily, with the Science Museum showing the largest relative growth.
>
> In 2010, the British Museum received around 5 million visitors, which increased gradually to nearly 7 million by 2020. The Natural History Museum started with just below 4 million visitors and surpassed 5 million visitors in 2020. The Science Museum initially attracted the fewest visitors, just above 3 million, but this figure nearly doubled to 6 million by 2020.
>
> To conclude, the data indicate a rising trend in the popularity of all three museums, with the Science Museum gaining the most visitors over the decade.

### IELTS Writing Task 2 Sample Answer (Opinion Essay)

> In recent years, some argue that universities should provide free education for all students. I fully agree with this view as it promotes equal opportunities and benefits society as a whole.
>
> Firstly, making education free removes financial barriers for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, allowing them to pursue studies they otherwise could not afford. This fosters social mobility and helps reduce inequality.
>
> Secondly, an educated population contributes positively to economic growth and innovation. Graduates are more likely to find employment and contribute taxes, thus benefiting the economy.
>
> Critics may say that free education causes a burden on government finance, but investing in education is an investment in future prosperity.
>
> In conclusion, free university education benefits both individuals and society. Countries that provide such opportunities are likely to flourish in the long run.
