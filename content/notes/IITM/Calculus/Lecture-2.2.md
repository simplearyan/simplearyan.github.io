The video "Calculus 1 Lecture 2.2: Techniques of Differentiation (Finding Derivatives Easily)" by Professor Leonard teaches practical methods for calculating derivatives, focusing on simplifying the process and introducing rules to find derivatives efficiently.

***

## Key Concepts and Techniques:

### 1. Derivative of a Constant Function üéØ

- A constant function \$ y = c \$ is a horizontal line with slope zero.
- Therefore, the derivative of any constant function is zero (\$ \frac{d}{dx} c = 0 \$).
- This is a foundational rule simplifying many problems.


### 2. Using the Definition of Derivative Formula üî¢

- The derivative of a function \$ f(x) \$ is defined as:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$
- You find \$ f(x+h) \$, calculate the difference from \$ f(x) \$, divide by \$ h \$, and then compute the limit as \$ h \to 0 \$.
- This process has been used to calculate derivatives for polynomials and functions involving radicals.


### 3. Power Rule for Derivatives ‚úã

- The **power rule** is a shortcut discovered from applying the limit definition repeatedly:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}
$$
- It allows quick differentiation of polynomial terms without manually using the limit formula.


### 4. Derivative of Polynomials and Combining Terms üìö

- Derivative works term-by-term:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [x^3 - 4x] = \frac{d}{dx} x^3 - \frac{d}{dx} 4x = 3x^2 - 4
$$
- Constants multiply through without changing, e.g.,

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [5x^4] = 5 \cdot \frac{d}{dx} x^4 = 20 x^3
$$


### 5. Derivatives with Negative and Fractional Powers ‚ÜóÔ∏è‚ÜòÔ∏è

- Negative exponents mean division:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^{-n} = -n x^{-n - 1}
$$
- Fractional powers represent roots:

$$
x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x}
$$

Can use power rule similarly.

### 6. Special Cases and Practice üßÆ

- Derivative of linear functions like \$ y = 3x + 5 \$:
    - Derivative is the constant coefficient of \$ x \$, here 3.
- Derivative of sums/differences:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)
$$
- Derivative of constants is zero.


### 7. Approximate Derivatives Without Limits üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

- Power rule and sum rules allow rapid calculation without limit process.
- Example:
    - For \$ f(x) = 3x^9 - x^3 + x - 7 \$, derivative is:

$$
f'(x) = 27x^8 - 3x^2 + 1
$$
- This method enables solving derivative problems quickly and accurately.


### 8. Applications: Horizontal Tangents and Beyond üìà

- Setting the derivative equal to zero finds points where the curve has a horizontal tangent (potential maxima/minima).
- Example:
    - If \$ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 \$,
    - Set \$ 3x^2 - 3 = 0 \$ solving gives \$ x = \pm 1 \$.


### 9. Higher-Order Derivatives üîÑ

- Can take multiple derivatives of a function sequentially.
- Notations include:
    - \$ f''(x) \$ or \$ \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} \$ for second derivative,
    - \$ f'''(x) \$ or \$ \frac{d^3 y}{dx^3} \$ for third, etc.
- For polynomials, derivatives eventually zero out after repeated differentiation.

## Summary

This lecture teaches fundamental derivative calculation shortcuts:

- Power rule makes polynomial differentiation simple,
- Constants differentiate to zero,
- Derivatives distribute across sums/differences,
- Enables easy identification of horizontal tangent points,
- Sets the stage for more advanced derivative applications and higher-order derivatives.
