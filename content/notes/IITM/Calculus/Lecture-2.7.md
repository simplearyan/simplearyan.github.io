The video "Calculus 1 Lecture 2.7: Implicit Differentiation" by Professor Leonard teaches the method of implicit differentiation, which is used to find derivatives of functions defined implicitly, i.e., where \$ y \$ is not isolated explicitly as a function of \$ x \$.

***

## Explanation of the Video:

### 1. What is Implicit Differentiation?

- **Implicit differentiation** is a technique used when variables $x$ and $y$ are mixed together in an equation, and $y$ is not isolated on one side.
- Instead of solving for $y$ explicitly, you differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as an implicit function of $x$.
- This means whenever you differentiate a term with $y$, you apply the chain rule and multiply by $\frac{dy}{dx}$.


### 2. The Process

- **Step 1:** Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$.
- **Step 2:** Whenever differentiating terms involving $y$, multiply by $\frac{dy}{dx}$ (also denoted $y'$).
- **Step 3:** Collect all terms involving $\frac{dy}{dx}$ on one side.
- **Step 4:** Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to find the derivative.


### 3. Applications

- Implicit differentiation allows calculation of slopes of curves defined by complicated relations (like circles, ellipses) without explicitly solving for $y$.
- It can be used to find tangents at specific points.


### 4. Examples and Common Steps

- The video shows setting up derivatives on both sides, careful handling of $y$ terms by using chain rule.
- To handle quotient-type functions, use the quotient rule.
- Simplify algebraically, rearranging to solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$.


### 5. Practical Outcomes

- Determine slopes $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at points on implicitly defined curves.
- Use the slope and point to write the equation of the tangent line to the curve.

## Summary

This lecture focuses on **implicit differentiation**, a core technique for differentiation when $y$ is not explicitly isolated:

- Differentiate implicitly by treating $y$ as a function of $x$.
- Use chain rule on $y$-terms, multiply by $\frac{dy}{dx}$.
- Rearrange and solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to get the derivative.
- Apply to find slopes and tangent lines on implicitly defined curves.

Professor Leonard thoroughly explains the steps and applications, preparing students to handle complex curves and real-world problems where $y$ is not isolated.

If needed, examples and practice problems can further illustrate the method.
