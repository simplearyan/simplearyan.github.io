The video "Calculus 1 Lecture 1.4: Continuity of Functions" by Professor Leonard provides a clear and thorough explanation of the concept of continuity in calculus, including precise definitions, types of discontinuities, and how to determine whether a function is continuous at a point or on an interval.

## Key Points Covered in the Video

### What Is Continuity? üñäÔ∏è

- **Informal Definition:** A function is *continuous* if you can draw its graph without lifting your pencil. No breaks, holes, or vertical asymptotes (ASM tootes).
- A function is graphically continuous if there are no sudden jumps or gaps.


### Formal Definition of Continuity at a Point \$ c \$ ‚úîÔ∏è

A function \$ f \$ is continuous at a point \$ c \$ if the following three conditions **all** hold:

1. **Function is defined at \$ c \$:** \$ f(c) \$ exists.
2. **Limit at \$ c \$ exists:** \$ \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \$ exists.
3. **Limit equals function value:** \$ \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c) \$.

If any of these fail, \$ f \$ is *not* continuous at \$ c \$.

### Examples of Discontinuities üöß

- **Removable Discontinuity (Hole):** The limit exists and the function approaches the same value from left and right, but \$ f(c) \$ is either not defined or doesn‚Äôt equal the limit. You can ‚Äúfix‚Äù this by redefining \$ f(c) \$.
- **Jump Discontinuity:** The left-hand and right-hand limits exist but aren‚Äôt equal, so the limit doesn‚Äôt exist. The function ‚Äújumps‚Äù from one value to another.
- **Infinite Discontinuity (Vertical Asymptote):** The function grows without bound near \$ c \$, so the limit tends to infinity or negative infinity.


### Continuity on Intervals üìà

- If \$ f \$ is continuous at every point within an interval $(a, b)$, then \$ f \$ is *continuous on the interval*.
- For **closed intervals** $[a, b]$, continuity at the endpoints requires *one-sided* limits:
    - At \$ a \$, require right-hand limit equals \$ f(a) \$.
    - At \$ b \$, require left-hand limit equals \$ f(b) \$.
- Use bracket/parentheses notation to indicate whether endpoints are included in continuity.


### Relationship with Polynomials and Rational Functions

- All **polynomials** are continuous everywhere.
- A **rational function** (polynomial divided by polynomial) is continuous on its domain ‚Äî everywhere except where the denominator equals zero.
- Points where the denominator zero causes discontinuities (holes or asymptotes).


### Checking Continuity: Step-by-Step Approach üîç

1. Check if \$ f(c) \$ is defined.
2. Check the existence and equality of left- and right-hand limits at \$ c \$.
3. Determine the type of discontinuity if not continuous:
    - Hole: can redefine \$ f(c) \$ to make continuous.
    - Jump discontinuity: cannot fix with simple redefinition.
    - Infinite discontinuity: vertical asymptote behavior.

### Summary:

This lecture equips learners to:

- Understand the intuitive and precise mathematical definitions of continuity.
- Identify types of discontinuities in graphs and functions.
- Analyze continuity at points and on intervals, including endpoints.
- Apply polynomial and rational function properties to continuity.
- Use limits and function values to verify or refute continuity.

Professor Leonard‚Äôs explanations provide a solid foundation for appreciating continuous functions, which are central to calculus and its applications.

If you want, I can also provide examples or exercises on continuity to help deepen understanding.
