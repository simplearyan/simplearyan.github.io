The video titled "Calculus 1 Lecture 3.1: Increasing/Decreasing and Concavity of Functions" by Professor Leonard teaches how to understand and analyze the behavior of functions in terms of increasing/decreasing intervals, concavity, and critical points.

## Explanation:

### 1. Increasing and Decreasing Functions

- A function is **increasing** on intervals where its values go up as $x$ moves from left to right.
- A function is **decreasing** on intervals where its values go down as $x$ moves from left to right.
- On the graph, increasing intervals correspond to portions where the slope (derivative, $f'(x)$) is **positive**.
- Decreasing intervals are where the slope is **negative**.
- On intervals where the slope is zero, the function is **constant** (flat).
- Points where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa often correspond to peaks and valleys (maxima and minima).


### 2. Relationship Between $f'(x)$ and Function Behavior

- $f'(x) > 0$ ⇒ $f$ is increasing.
- $f'(x) < 0$ ⇒ $f$ is decreasing.
- $f'(x) = 0$ ⇒ potential relative maximum, minimum, or flat spot.


### 3. Concavity and $f''(x)$

- **Concavity** describes how the function curves:
    - **Concave up:** The graph bends upward, like a cup that holds water.
    - **Concave down:** The graph bends downward, like an upside-down cup.
- Concavity relates to the **second derivative** $f''(x)$, the rate of change of the slope.
    - If $f''(x) > 0$, the function is concave up (slope increasing).
    - If $f''(x) < 0$, the function is concave down (slope decreasing).
- When the second derivative changes sign, the graph has an **inflection point** (a change from concave up to down or vice versa).


### 4. Critical Numbers and Extrema

- **Critical numbers** are $x$-values where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x)$ is undefined.
- At these points, the function could have a **relative maximum** or **relative minimum**.
- Relative maxima occur where the graph moves from increasing to decreasing.
- Relative minima occur where the graph moves from decreasing to increasing.
- Not all critical numbers correspond to extrema (some can be inflection points).


### 5. Absolute Maximum and Minimum

- **Absolute extrema** are the highest or lowest points on the graph within a given interval.
- Absolute extrema occur either at critical numbers or at the endpoints of a closed interval.
- On open intervals or unbounded domains, absolute extrema may not exist.


### 6. Summary of How to Analyze a Function

- Find the first derivative $f'(x)$ to locate increasing/decreasing intervals and critical points.
- Find the second derivative $f''(x)$ to determine concavity and inflection points.
- Use critical and endpoint values to determine relative and absolute maxima/minima.

## Summary

The lecture helps learners to:

- Understand **how to use the first derivative** to determine where functions are increasing or decreasing.
- Use the **second derivative to understand concavity** and locate inflection points.
- Identify **critical points and use them to find relative maxima and minima**.
- Understand the differences between relative and absolute extrema, especially on different intervals.
- Prepare for analyzing and sketching graphs of functions effectively using derivatives.

This is fundamental for understanding function behavior and lays the groundwork for curve sketching and optimization topics in calculus.
