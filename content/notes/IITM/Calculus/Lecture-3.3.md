The video titled **"Calculus 1 Lecture 3.3: The First Derivative Test"** by Professor Leonard focuses on the first derivative test, a method used to determine intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing, and to identify relative maxima and minima.

***

## Explanation:

### 1. **Purpose of the First Derivative Test**

- The first derivative test helps determine:
    - Where a function is **increasing** (going uphill).
    - Where it is **decreasing** (going downhill).
    - Locations of **relative maxima** (peaks) and **relative minima** (valleys).


### 2. **Recap: What Derivatives Tell Us**

- The **first derivative $f'(x)$** indicates **slope** or **rate of change** of the function.
- If $f'(x) > 0$, the function is **increasing**.
- If $f'(x) < 0$, the function is **decreasing**.
- If $f'(x) = 0$, the function has a **horizontal tangent** (possible local max, min, or neither).


### 3. **Steps of the First Derivative Test**

- **Step 1:** Find the first derivative $f'(x)$.
- **Step 2:** Set $f'(x) = 0$ to find **critical numbers**.
- **Step 3:** Create a **number line** and mark these critical points.
- **Step 4:** Choose test points from each interval divided by critical numbers.
- **Step 5:** Plug test points into $f'(x)$ to determine the sign (+ or -) of the derivative.
- **Step 6:** Based on signs, determine if the function is increasing (+) or decreasing (-) on those intervals.
- **Step 7:** Identify relative maxima where $f'(x)$ changes from positive to negative and relative minima where $f'(x)$ changes from negative to positive.


### 4. **Handling Points Where Derivative Is Undefined**

- Include points where $f'(x)$ is **undefined** but the function is defined because the slope's behavior might change there.
- These points could also be critical points and must be considered in the test.


### 5. **Example Highlighted in the Video**

- Given a function, the derivative is taken, and critical points are identified.
- A sign chart is constructed to evaluate the derivative's sign in each interval.
- By analyzing signs, relative maxima and minima points are located.
- Values of the original function at critical points are used to find actual coordinates of max/min points.


### 6. **Summary of Findings**

- Positive derivative = growing function.
- Negative derivative = decreasing function.
- Zero or undefined derivative = possible peak or valley.
- The first derivative test is a practical method to analyze and sketch the behavior of functions based on their derivatives.


### 7. **Towards Future Topics**

- The lecture also lays groundwork to complement the **second derivative test**, which analyzes concavity to classify maxima and minima more precisely.

## Summary

Professor Leonard's lecture on the **First Derivative Test** teaches students how to use the sign of the derivative to determine where a function increases or decreases and how to find local maxima and minima. The method involves finding critical points (where derivative equals zero or is undefined), testing intervals around these points, and checking the sign of the derivative in each.

This test aids in understanding function behavior, assisting in graphing, optimization, and preparing for more advanced tests using second derivatives.
