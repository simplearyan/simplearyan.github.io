This video, "Calculus 1 Lecture 0.3: Review of Trigonometry and Graphing Trigonometric Functions" by Professor Leonard, gives a thorough refresher on essential trigonometry topics and how to graph trigonometric functions—skills you’ll use repeatedly in calculus.

## Main Topics Covered

### Angles \& Their Measurement 🌐

- **Angles** are measured from the x-axis, with the initial side along the axis and the terminal side at the end of the angle.
- **Counterclockwise rotation** yields positive angles, while **clockwise rotation** yields negative angles.
- Angles can be measured in **degrees** or **radians**.
    - Key conversion: \$ 2\pi \$ radians = 360°, so \$ 1 radian = \frac{180}{\pi}^\circ \$.
    - To convert degrees to radians: multiply by \$ \frac{\pi}{180} \$.
    - To convert radians to degrees: multiply by \$ \frac{180}{\pi} \$.


### Unit Circle \& Reference Angles 🟢

- The **unit circle** (radius 1) is central to understanding trigonometric functions.
- Any angle and point on the circle can be related to a right triangle with sides of length x and y.
- The **reference angle** is the acute angle between the terminal side of a given angle and the x-axis. Depending on which quadrant the angle lies in, the reference angle formula changes—this helps in computing trigonometric values for any angle.


### Trigonometric Functions Definition ⚡

- The six main trig functions relate sides of a right triangle:
    - \$ \sin \theta = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} \$
    - \$ \cos \theta = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} \$
    - \$ \tan \theta = \frac{opposite}{adjacent} \$
    - Their reciprocals are: \$ \csc \theta, \sec \theta, \cot \theta \$.
- On the unit circle:
    - The x-coordinate is cosine of the angle, and the y-coordinate is sine.


### Sign of Functions in Quadrants 🧭

- In different quadrants, some trig functions are positive:
    - **Quadrant I**: All positive
    - **Quadrant II**: Sine positive
    - **Quadrant III**: Tangent positive
    - **Quadrant IV**: Cosine positive
- Mnemonic: All Students Take Calculus.


### Using Reference Angles and Quadrants to Compute Values 🔢

- To find a trig function for any angle:

1. Identify the quadrant.
2. Find the reference angle.
3. Use the unit circle or triangle to find the function’s value at the reference angle.
4. Assign the correct sign, based on the quadrant.


### Graphing Trigonometric Functions 📉

- **Graphs of sine, cosine, and tangent functions** are explored.
- The general forms: \$ y = a \sin(bx) \$ and \$ y = a \cos(bx) \$
    - **Amplitude** ($|a|$): How high/low the graph goes from the middle.
    - **Period** ($2\pi/|b|$): How long it takes for the function to repeat.
- Changing $a$ stretches/compresses vertically, changing $b$ compresses/stretches horizontally (affecting the period).
- Professor Leonard demonstrates by graphing \$ y = \sin(x) \$ and \$ y = 2\sin(4x) \$ and compares their amplitude and period.


### Summary of Skills Reviewed

- Converting angles between degrees and radians.
- Visualizing angles and points on the unit circle.
- Understanding trigonometric function definitions and their signs in different quadrants.
- Using reference angles for computation.
- Analyzing and graphing trigonometric functions, including amplitude and period.
