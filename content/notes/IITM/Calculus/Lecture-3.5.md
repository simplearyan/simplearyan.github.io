The video titled **"Calculus 1 Lecture 3.5: Limits of Functions at Infinity"** by Professor Leonard explores how to evaluate limits of functions as the variable approaches infinity or negative infinity, focusing on the behavior of rational functions and polynomials.

***

## Explanation:

### 1. **Recap of Limits and Vertical Asymptotes**

- Limits approaching a finite value sometimes lead to **removable discontinuities** (holes in graphs) if numerator and denominator both equal zero.
- If the denominator equals zero but numerator does not, the function has a **vertical asymptote (ASM toote)**, meaning the function grows without bound near that point.


### 2. **Evaluating Limits at Infinity**

- Limits at infinity describe behavior as $x \to +\infty$ or $x \to -\infty$.
- For rational functions, the limit at infinity depends on the degrees of numerator and denominator polynomials.


### 3. **Key Strategies**

- To evaluate limits of rational functions at infinity, divide numerator and denominator by the highest power of $x$ in the denominator.
- Simplify terms, and use the fact that any constant divided by infinity tends to zero.
- This method helps avoid the indeterminate form $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$.


### 4. **Behavior of Polynomials**

- Polynomials tend to $\pm \infty$ as $x$ approaches $\pm \infty$ based on the leading term.
- For example, $x^3$ approaches $\infty$ as $x \to \infty$, but $-x^3$ approaches $-\infty$.
- The sign and degree of the leading term determine end behavior.


### 5. **Horizontal Asymptotes**

- When the limit at infinity is a finite number, it corresponds to a **horizontal asymptote**.
- Horizontal asymptotes indicate the value the function approaches but may never reach as $x$ grows large.


### 6. **Examples**

- Many examples show how to find limits by simplifying and factoring.
- Examples include functions with roots, powers, and rational expressions.
- Techniques like rewriting roots as fractional powers, carefully handling absolute values, and using piecewise definitions for absolute values are shown.


### 7. **Important Details**

- Absolute values matter when dealing with limits towards negative infinity.
- Expressions under roots and powers require special attention for correct simplification.
- Careful manipulation avoids incorrect cancellation or misinterpretation of signs.

## Summary

Professor Leonard’s lecture explains how to analyze and compute **limits of functions as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity**, a fundamental concept to understanding end behavior, horizontal asymptotes, and global trends of functions. The video covers:

- Strategies to simplify expressions by dividing by the highest denominator power.
- Behavior of polynomials dominated by leading terms.
- Handling of roots and absolute values in limits.
- Identifying horizontal asymptotes and their significance.

This knowledge is essential for sketching graphs, studying asymptotic behavior, and solving real-world problems where inputs get very large or very small.The video titled **"Calculus 1 Lecture 3.5: Limits of Functions at Infinity"** by Professor Leonard explains how to evaluate the limits of functions as the input variable approaches positive or negative infinity, focusing particularly on rational functions and polynomials.

## Explanation:

### 1. **Vertical and Removable Discontinuities**

- When the denominator of a rational function equals zero and the numerator does not, the function has a **vertical asymptote** (ASM toote).
- If numerator and denominator both equal zero at a point, this creates a **removable discontinuity** or a hole, meaning the function is undefined at a single point but can be simplified elsewhere.


### 2. **Limits at Infinity**

- To find limits as \$ x \to \pm \infty \$, divide both numerator and denominator of rational functions by the highest power of \$ x \$ in the denominator.
- Terms with \$ x \$ in the denominator vanish (go to zero) because constants divided by very large numbers approach zero.
- The limit then often simplifies to a ratio of the leading coefficients.


### 3. **Behavior of Polynomials at Infinity**

- Polynomial functions tend to infinity or negative infinity based on the degree and sign of their leading term.
- For example, \$ x^3 \to \infty \$ as \$ x \to \infty \$, and \$ -x^3 \to -\infty \$ as \$ x \to \infty \$.
- Polynomials do not have horizontal asymptotes because they grow without bound as \$ |x| \to \infty \$.


### 4. **Horizontal Asymptotes**

- Horizontal asymptotes occur when the limit at infinity approaches a finite constant.
- This generally happens for rational functions where the degree of the numerator and denominator are equal or numerator degree is less.


### 5. **Handling Roots and Absolute Values**

- When functions involve roots, rewrite roots as fractional exponents to apply limit rules.
- Be careful with absolute values, especially when considering limits as \$ x \to -\infty \$, as absolute values behave differently for positive and negative inputs.
- Use the piecewise definition of absolute value to correctly evaluate limits.


### 6. **Examples and Calculations**

- Various examples demonstrate dividing through by the highest power, simplifying expressions, and evaluating resulting limits.
- Thorough algebraic steps ensure correct handling of indeterminate forms such as \$ \frac{\infty}{\infty} \$ or roots over polynomials.

## Summary

This lecture teaches how to evaluate limits of functions as variables approach infinity by focusing on the dominant terms and simplifying rational functions appropriately. It covers:

- Methods to find vertical asymptotes and removable discontinuities,
- Approaches to take limits at \$ \pm \infty \$ for rational functions and polynomials,
- Understanding of horizontal asymptotes as finite limits at infinity,
- Proper handling of roots and absolute values in limit calculations.

These techniques are vital for analyzing the end behavior of functions and foundational for graphing and further calculus studies.
